 * handlers check this on entry: if it matches their own vector, they
 * call fault_kill_current() instead of the diagnostic-and-halt path.
 * Otherwise they behave exactly as before.
 *
 * g_fault_observed is -1 until a fault is taken with g_expect_fault
 * set; the handler then records the vector here.  The self-test reads
 * this after the kernel shell resumes to decide pass/fail.
 *
 * -1 is used rather than 0 because 0 is the #DE vector and would be
 * indistinguishable from "no fault expected".
 *
 * Both are written from interrupt context and read from process
 * context.  The kernel is single-CPU, so a plain volatile int is
 * sufficient; no atomics or memory barriers are required.

 * back to the kernel shell.  Does not return.
 *
 * The child process that triggers the fault must be a kernel-mode
 * process (entry_point >= KERNEL_BASE).  process_exit() uses that
