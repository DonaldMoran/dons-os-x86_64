/*
 * Shared print lock.
 *
 * Reentrant cli/sti critical section with a nesting counter. Both the
 * serial driver and the VGA driver use this lock, so a whole
 * serial_print or vga_print (or a PRINT_BOTH pair that wraps its two
 * calls in an explicit lock/unlock) is atomic against timer
 * preemption.
 *
 * serial_lock() disables interrupts and increments a depth counter.
 * serial_unlock() decrements it and re-enables interrupts only when
 * the depth returns to zero. Nested lock/unlock pairs are safe.
 *
 * The individual *_putc functions do NOT take the lock. They are
 * intended to be called from within a locked region. Any function that
 * prints more than one character must take the lock around the whole
 * operation, or a timer tick between characters will interleave other
 * output.
 *
 * Limitations (see MAINTENANCE.md items 4d / 4e):
 *   - Holds interrupts off for the duration of the print. At 115200
 *     baud a 40-char line takes ~3.5 ms; VGA is faster but still
 *     preemptible for the duration. Fine for boot messages and short
 *     diagnostics. Not a design for high-frequency kernel printing.
 *   - Global, not per-console. With multiple users this would need to
 *     become a per-tty lock.
 *   - Not SMP-safe. cli/sti is meaningless on the other CPU.
 *
 * The correct long-term design is a ring buffer drained by a console
 * task, with per-console locks. This lock is a pragmatic fix for the
 * current single-console, single-core configuration.
